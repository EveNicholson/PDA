# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
# Lists in programming are used to collect similar items in a single variable so they are easy to read and understand.
# We create a list by surrounding all the elements with square brackets [] and each element separated by commas.
# The function I used is adding new employee to the employees list.
